                Zimbabwe war against drugs 
            </h1>
            <p>
                Zimbabwe battling growing drug addiction among youth.
                The problem has gone beyond imported drugs. Reports indicate some young people take local concoctions, others even dip diapers and bleach products in boiling water and then inhale the vapours as intoxicants.Over the years, law enforcement agencies have launched numerous initiatives to curtail the menace, including raids and roadblocks, but most of them have failed.
                <br>
                Zimbabwean authorities say they are <strong>''leaving no stone unturned''</strong> in the fight 
                <br>
                In 2021, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa set up an inter-ministerial committee which came up with the Zimbabwe National Drug Master Plan (ZNDMP 2020 to 2025) and Treatment and Rehabilitation Guidelines of Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder of Zimbabwe (TRGASUD ZIM). Progress and achievements made under the plan have not been made public.

                    Statics About Drug Abuse In Zimbabwe
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Though there are no government data on the prevalence of hard drugs in the country, a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) on mental health among young people in the African region notes that the country has the highest number of 15-19 year-olds who engage in heavy episodic drinking.
                    <br>
                    The report added that their number stood at 70.7 percent among men and 55 percent among women.
                    <br>
                    Statistics compiled in 2021 by the Zimbabwe Civil Liberties and Drug Network revealed that 60 per cent of psychiatric admissions were due to drug abuse. Eighty per cent of these were people aged 16 to 25, including schoolgirls.
                    <br>
                    “As it stands, 60 percent of patients admitted to mental institutions suffer due to drug and substance abuse-related problems,” highlightedd The Ministry of Health and Child Care.

                    How Drugs Are Accessed and Distributed in Zimbabwe
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Whilst drug trafficking is rampant across Zimbabwe, primarily through its porous borders, South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique have emerged as new sources for both hard and prescription drugs, including bronclear (a cough syrup containing codeine), moonshine knowns locally as tumbwa or kozoda, crystal meth and prescription drugs such as Diazepam, Ketamine and Pethidine, morphine and Fentanyl.
                    <br>
                    Zimbabwean law enforcement often search vehicles and travelers for drugs. 
                    Local media reports indicate that over the years, more than 50 women have been arrested for drug trafficking. The Africa Report said that six Zimbabwean women had died when they swallowed the drugs they were smuggling to avoid arrest.
                    <br>
                    Apart from imported drugs, locals are also flooding the market with cheap, highly intoxicating substitutes such as musombodiya, a colourless drink made from ethanol and emblements powders manufactured and distributed mainly at bus terminus and the ghettos.
                    <br>
                    Reports said young addicts are even dipping diapers and bleach products in boiling water and inhaling the vapours as intoxicants.
                    <br>
                    “Drug abusers can take anything that they think will keep them euphoric or sedated and cases of organic psychosis are on the rise,” noted The Medical and Dental Private Practitioners’ Association of Zimbabwe.

            <h1>Drugs</h1>
            <h2>Drugs Destroy And Ruin millions of Lives every year. <br>What You Should Know About Them?</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>How Do Drugs Work?</h3>
                <h4>Drugs are essentially poisons. The amount taken determines the effect.</h4>
                <div id="effects" class="effects">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            A small amount acts as stimulant (speeds you up). A greater amount acts as sedative (slows you down). An even larger amount poisons and can kill.
                            <br>
                            This is true of any drug. Only the amount needed to achieve the effect differs.
                            <br>
                            But Many drugs have another liability: they directly affect the mind. They can distort the user's perception of what is happeningaround him or her. As a Result the person's actions may be odd, irrational, inappropriate and even destructive
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Drugs block off all sensations, the desirable ones with the unwanted. So,  while providing short-term help in the relief of pain, they also wipe out ability and alterness and muddy one's thinking.
                            <br>
                            Medicines are drugs that are intended to speed up or slow down or change something about the way your body is working, to try to make it work better. Sometimes they are necessary, But they are still drugs: they act as stimulants or sedatives, and too much can kill you. So if you do not use medicines as they are supposed to be used, they can be as dangerous as illegal drugs.
                        </p>

                            Drugs Affect The Mind
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Normally, when a person remembers something, the mind is very fast and information comes to him quickly. But drugs blur memory, causing blank spots. When a person tries to get information through this cloudy mess, he can't do it. Drugs make a person feel slow or stupid and cause him to have failuers in life. And as he has more failures and life gets harder, he wants more drugs to help him deal with the problem.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Drugs Destroy Creativity</h4>
                        <p>
                            One lie told about drugs is that they help a person become more creative.The truth is quite different.
                            <br>
                            Someone who is sad might use drugs to get a feeling of happiness, but it does not work. Drugs can lift a person into a fake kind of cheerfulness, but when the drug wears off, he or she crashes even lower than before. And each time, the emotionelplunge is lower and lower. Eventually, drugs will completely destroy all the creativity a person has.

                            Dagga (marijuana) is usually rolled up in a cigarette called a joint or a snail (leaf). It can also be brewed as a tea or mixed with food, or smoked through a water pipe calleed a bong.
                            <br>
                            Dagga is the most commonly used illegal drug in Zimbabwe. It is is often more potent today than it used to be. Growing techniques and selectiveuse of seeds have produced a more powerful drug. As a result, there has been aa sharp increase in the number of dagga-related emergency room vists by young weed smokers.
